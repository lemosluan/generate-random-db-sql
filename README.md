# Generate databases and users from Relational Databases
Generate a random database and user with privilges for any purpose

# How to Use
- Open the file
- Change `$hostname`, `$username` and `$password` with your credentials with access to create databases and users
```
$host = 'localhost';
$username = 'root';
$password = 'root';
```
- Execute on VSCode with [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
- Or by the terminal (in the folder) execute `php index.php`

# Take care
Once you execute the code and **exit** from vscode or from the terminal, the user password will be lost. So remember to save it!
